{"name":"Tilt Shift Plugin","body":"What is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n*Gallery Tilt Shift Plugin* is a filter for the Gallery application of the N9\r\n(and N950) MeeGo devices which makes a picture look like a miniature.\r\n\r\nFrom the [Wikipedia] [1],\r\n> *Tilt-shift photography* refers to the use of camera movements on\r\n> small- and medium-format cameras, and sometimes specifically refers\r\n> to the use of tilt for selective focus, often for simulating a miniature\r\n> scene. Sometimes the term is used when the shallow depth of field is simulated\r\n> with digital post-processing; the name may derive from the tilt-shift lens\r\n> normally required when the effect is produced optically.\r\n\r\nMaking an photograph of a life-size location or object look like photograph\r\nof a miniature scale model is known as [Miniature faking] [2]. There are several\r\nways to achieve that result, and *fake Tilt Shift* is one of them.\r\n\r\nApplying Tilt Shift to a picture:\r\n---------------------------------\r\n * From the application grid, open Gallery\r\n * Pick a picture with a size equal or smaller than 512x512px (see Known Issues below)\r\n * Tap on the object menu and select *Edit*\r\n * Tap on *Tilt Shift*\r\n * Select the orientation of the focus (horizontal / vertical). In that\r\n   orientation, the focused area will take all available space\r\n * Select the radius of the focus: that will rule the size of the focused\r\n   area in the other orientation\r\n * Tap on the screen to center the focus around the given point\r\n\r\nKnown Issues:\r\n-------------\r\n * Only *PR >= 1.2* is currently supported.\r\n * [Issue #1][5]: You will need to reboot to make the icon for the plugin appear properly\r\n * [Issue #2][6]: Due to limitations in the current implementation of the filter, operating on\r\n   images larger than 512x512 is very slow and causes artifacts.\r\n\r\nPlease, feel free to report any other issues you might find in our [bug tracker][4]\r\n\r\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_photography \"Tilt-shift photography\"\r\n[2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_faking \"Miniature Faking\"\r\n[4]: https://github.com/Igalia/gallery-tiltshift-plugin/issues\r\n[5]: https://github.com/Igalia/gallery-tiltshift-plugin/issues/1\r\n[6]: https://github.com/Igalia/gallery-tiltshift-plugin/issues/2\r\n","tagline":"Tilt Shift plugin for Gallery","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
